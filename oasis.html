                Oasis - Don't Look Back In Anger
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Oasis</strong> was a British rock band formed in Manchester in 1991 by brothers Liam Gallagher (vocals) and Noel Gallagher (guitar, songwriting). They became one of the most influential and successful bands of the 1990s, leading the Britpop movement alongside bands like Blur and Pulp. 
                Known for their anthemic choruses, raw energy, and Gallagher brothers' infamous feuds, Oasis left an indelible mark on rock history.

                Oasis was heavily influenced by classic rock bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Stone Roses. Their music is characterized by powerful melodies, distorted yet melodic guitars, and straightforward, emotionally charged lyrics. Noel Gallagher's songwriting, often compared to Lennon-McCartney, combined with Liam Gallagher's distinctive sneering vocals, 
                created a signature sound that defined the 1990s.

                While Oasis may be no more, the legacy of the band and the Gallagher brothersâ€™ solo careers continue to thrive. Fans still hold onto the hope of a reunion, but for now, Noel and Liam are focusing on their individual paths. Oasis will forever be remembered as one of the greatest bands of the 90s, 
                whose music defined a generation.
